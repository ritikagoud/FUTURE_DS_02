# Task 2: 📊Social Media Campaign Performance Analysis

## Objective
Analyze ad campaign data (Facebook/Instagram style) to evaluate campaign performance and understand engagement, CTR, CPC, and ROI using Python.

## Insights
- Total Products Sold: 2.1 Million+
- Highest correlation with sales: Affiliate Marketing
- Lowest impact: Influencer Marketing
- ROI is high when total cost is moderate.
- CTR distribution is right-skewed (few ads get very high CTR).

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Metrics
- **CTR (Click Through Rate)** = Clicks ÷ Impressions × 100  
- **CPC (Cost per Click)** = Cost ÷ Clicks  
- **ROI (Return on Investment)** = (Product_Sold − Cost) ÷ Cost  

## Visualizations
- Correlation Heatmap
- ROI vs Cost Scatter Plot
